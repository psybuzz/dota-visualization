INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

The visualization presents users first with an overview of the players.  For this particular match, we have team DK and team EG.  Once you click on a player, you will be presented with a detailed view with three tabs: charts, role counterpart comparison, and team comparison.  Click on any of these tabs to view alternate views, or click on the back button in the upper left corner to return to the main overview.
